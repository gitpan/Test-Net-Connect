NAME
    Test::Net::Connect - Test::Builder based tests for network connectivity

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Net::Connect tests => 3;

        connect_ok({ host => 'smtp.example.com', port => 25,
                     proto => 'tcp' }, 'Check tcp://smtp.example.com:25');

        # proto defaults to 'tcp', the test name can be omitted, and the
        # port can be appended to the host name
        connect_ok({ host => 'smtp.example.com:25' });

        connect_not_ok({ host => 'localhost:23' },
                       'Telnet connections should not be accepted locally');

    Test::Net::Connect automatically exports "connect_ok()" and
    "connect_not_ok()" to make it easier to test whether or not a network
    connection can be made from this host to a port on another host using
    TCP or UDP.

    Test::Net::Connect uses Test::Builder, so plays nicely with
    Test::Simple, Test::More, and other Test::Builder based modules.

FUNCTIONS
  connect_ok($spec, [ $test_name ]);
    connect_ok() tests that a connection to a host, given in $spec, can be
    made.

    The specification is a hashref that contains one or more keys. Valid
    keys are "host", "port", and "proto". Each value associated with the key
    is the value that entry is supposed to have.

    host
        Specifies the hostname or IP address to connect to. If a hostname is
        given then the A records for that host will be retrieved and
        connections will be made to all the A records in turn. If any of
        them fail then the test fails.

        "host" is mandatory.

    port
        Specifies the port to connect to. The port may also be specified by
        appending a colon ":" and the port number to the "host" value. If
        this is done then "port" is optional, otherwise "port" is mandatory.

    proto
        The protocol to use. "tcp" and "udp" are the only valid values. This
        key is optional, and defaults to "tcp" if it is not specified.

    The $test_name is optional. If it is not present then a sensible one is
    generated following the form

        Connecting to $proto://$host:$port

  connect_not_ok($spec, [ $test_name ]);
    connect_not_ok() tests that a connection to a host, given in $spec, can
    not be made.

    The arguments are handled in the same manner as for connect_ok().

    NOTE: connect_not_ok() will fail ("not ok") if the given host is not in
    the DNS. DNS.

EXAMPLES
    Verify that port 25 can be reached on all the A records for
    "smtp.example.com".

        connect_ok({ host => 'smtp.example.com', port => 25, 
                     proto => 'tcp' }, "Checking mail to smtp.example.com");

    Do the same thing, but shorter.

        connect_ok({ host => 'smtp.example.com:25' });

    Verify that the local SSH daemon is responding.

        connect_ok({ host => '127.0.0.1:22' });

    Verify that the host www.example.com is not running a server on port 80.

        connect_not_ok({ host => 'www.example.com:80' });
